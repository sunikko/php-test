## Laravel Tech Task Demo API

Thank you for taking the time to review this task submission.

This repository contains a simple Laravel RESTful API called Laravel Tech Task Demo API, which allows you to display, add, edit, and delete tasks. It follows Laravel best practices and is built using a NoSQL database (MongoDB).

## Key criteria:

1. A task is formed of a name (min 3, max 100 characters) and a description (min 10, max 5000 characters).
2. Create an endpoint to view all tasks (no user restrictions).
3. A secured URL is required to edit or delete a task. Provide the appropriate endpoints to do this when a task is created.
4. No user accounts/ authentication is required.
5. Should be a RESTful API with a base of: `/api/tasks`.
6. Uses a NoSQL database (this is already setup).
7. Appropriate Unit Tests.
8. Uses Laravel Best Practices.

## Bonus Criteria:

1. All requests should be logged in a log file via middleware.
2. Implement Soft Deleting.
